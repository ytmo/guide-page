## Origin
This page is firstly created by Google Mainland China Branch in 2011 due to chinese goveronment asked them to stop services. From then on, this page become a 'industry standard' in chinese IT circle.
But due to it was written in 2011, this page has lots of bugs and Google wont fix them, so I created this project to help developers that wanna guide users from the old URL to the new URL can have a template to use.
## Copyright year problem
Many have connect me that now is 2021, not 2011, but, I have already thought about the copyright year and I believe it can be a pay tribute to Google.
If you want to change it, just change it.
