## Origin
This page is firstly created by Google Mainland China Branch in 2011 due to Chinese goveronment asked them to stop services. From then on, this page become a 'industry standard' in chinese IT circle on creating leading pages in order to commemorate Google.

But due to it was written in 2011, this page has lots of bugs and Google wont fix them, so I created this project to help developers that wanna guide users from the old URL to the new URL can have a template to use.


## Copyright year problem
Many have contact me that now is 2022, not 2011, but, I have considered this copyright year issue and I believe keep as it is can be a pay tribute to Google Mainland China Branch.

If you want to change it, just change it.
